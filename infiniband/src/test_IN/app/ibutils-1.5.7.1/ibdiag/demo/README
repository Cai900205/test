IBIADG TOOLS DEMO:
==================

The set of files provided in this directory can be used to demo the
ibdiags capabilities to report various error conditions on the IB fabric.
The files should be used by the ibmgtsim to simulate the error and
then interactively invoke ibdiagnet/ibdiagpath to see the report.
