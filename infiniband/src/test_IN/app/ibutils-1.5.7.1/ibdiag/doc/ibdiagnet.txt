  ibdiagnet

SYNOPSYS
  ibdiagnet [-c <count>] [-v] [-r] [-t <topo-file>] [-s <sys-name>]
     [-i <dev-index>] [-p <port-num>] [-o <out-dir>]

DESCRIPTION
  ibdiagnet scans the fabric using directed route packets and extracts all the
  available information regarding its connectivity and devices.
  It then produces the following files in the output directory defined by the
  -o option (see below):
    ibdiagnet.lst    - List of all the nodes, ports and links in the fabric
    ibdiagnet.fdbs   - A dump of the unicast forwarding tables of the fabric
                        switches
    ibdiagnet.mcfdbs - A dump of the multicast forwarding tables of the fabric
                        switches
  In addition to generating the files above, the discovery phase also checks for
  duplicate node GUIDs in the IB fabric. If such an error is detected, it is
  displayed on the standard output.
  After the discovery phase is completed, directed route packets are sent
  multiple times (according to the -c option) to detect possible problematic
  paths on which packets may be lost. Such paths are explored, and a report of
  the suspected bad links is displayed on the standard output.
  After scanning the fabric, if the -r option is provided, a full report of the
  fabric qualities is displayed.
  This report includes:
    Number of nodes and systems
    Hop-count information:
         maximal hop-count, an example path, and a hop-count histogram
    All CA-to-CA paths traced
  Note: In case the IB fabric includes only one CA, then CA-to-CA paths are not
  reported.
  Furthermore, if a topology file is provided, ibdiagnet uses the names defined
  in it for the output reports.

OPTIONS
  -c <count>    : The minimal number of packets to be sent across each link
                  (default = 10)
  -v            : Instructs the tool to run in verbose mode
  -r            : Provides a report of the fabric qualities
  -t <topo-file>: Specifies the topology file name
  -s <sys-name> : Specifies the local system name. Meaningful only if a topology
                  file is specified
  -i <dev-index>: Specifies the index of the device of the port used to connect
                  to the IB fabric (in case of multiple devices on the local
                  system)
  -p <port-num> : Specifies the local device's port number used to connect to
                  the IB fabric
  -o <out-dir>  : Specifies the directory where the output files will be placed
                  (default = /tmp/ez)

  -h|--help     : Prints this help information
  -V|--version  : Prints the version of the tool
     --vars     : Prints the tool's environment variables and their values

ERROR CODES
  1 - Failed to fully discover the fabric
  2 - Failed to parse command line options
  3 - Some packet drop observed
  4 - Mismatch with provided topology
