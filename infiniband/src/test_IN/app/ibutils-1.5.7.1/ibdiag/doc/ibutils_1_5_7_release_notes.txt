1. Overview
===============================================================================

The ibutils package provides a set of diagnostic tools that check the health
of an InfiniBand fabric.

Package components:
ibis:     IB interface - A TCL shell that provides interface for sending various
          MADs on the IB fabric. This is the component that actually accesses
          the IB Hardware.

ibdm:     IB Data Model - A library that provides IB fabric analysis.

ibmgtsim: An IB fabric simulator. Useful for developing IB tools.

ibdiag:   This package provides 3 tools which provide the user interface
          to activate the above functionality:
            - ibdiagnet:  Performs various quality and health checks on the IB
                          fabric.
            - ibdiagpath: Performs various fabric quality and health checks on
                          the given links and nodes in a specific path.
            - ibdiagui:   A GUI wrapper for the above tools.

4. Known Issues
===============================================================================

- Ibdiagnet "-wt" option may generate a bad topology file when running on a
  cluster that contains complex switch systems.

- ibutils works only partially on RHEL6 and any other distro with TCL 8.5.
  ibdiagnet/ibdiagpath/ibis don't work with TCL 8.5 due to a change in
  TCL behavior: the built-in TCL function "dump" on TCL 8.5 always includes
  field names.
  Until the fix, any user script that uses ibis needs to be fixed in order
  to function correctly on TCL 8.5
