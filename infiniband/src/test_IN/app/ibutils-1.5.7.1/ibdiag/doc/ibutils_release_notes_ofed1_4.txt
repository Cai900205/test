1. Overview
===============================================================================

The ibutils package provides a set of diagnostic tools that check the health
of an InfiniBand fabric.
Package components:
ibis:     IB interface - A TCL shell that provides interface for sending various
          MADs on the IB fabric. This is the component that actually accesses
          the IB Hardware.

ibdm:     IB Data Model - A library that provides IB fabric analysis.

ibmgtsim: An IB fabric simulator. Useful for developing IB tools.

ibdiag:   This package provides 3 tools which provide the user interface
          to activate the above functionality:
            - ibdiagnet:  Performs various quality and health checks on the IB
                          fabric.
            - ibdiagpath: Performs various fabric quality and health checks on
                          the given links and nodes in a specific path.
            - ibdiagui:   A GUI wrapper for the above tools. 

===============================================================================
2. New Features
===============================================================================


* Mellanox InfiniScaleIV support:
  - Support switches with port count > 32
  - Added ibnl (IB network) files for MTS3600 and MTS3610 InfiniScaleIV based switch systems.

* IBDM QoS Credit Loop check: 
  This check now considers SL/VL when looking for credit loops. 
  This check can be activated by running "ibdiagnet -r"

* ibdiagnet: Added -csv flag, which generated a set of Comma Separated Values
             files, which contains data about the fabric. Generated files:
               inv_csv   - Lists the ports found in the fabric
               links_csv - Lists the ports connections in the fabric
               pm_csv    - Lists port counters in csv format 
               err_csv   - Lists errors found during the run

* ibmgtsim: Add basic M_Key mechanism simulation

===============================================================================
3. Major Bugs Fixed 
===============================================================================

* ibdm: Support 2 port switches in a loaded LST file.

* ibis: fix some buffer overrun bugs with long node description.

* Installation: Ibdiagui requires tcl/tk 8.4 or 8.5 (was only 8.4). This allows
                installation on Fedora Core 9.

* ibdiagnet: Fixed -pm flag caused a crash on back to back (no switch) setup.

* ibdiagnet: Do not query port counters when local port is in INIT state.

===============================================================================
4. Known Issues
===============================================================================

- Ibdiagnet "-wt" option may generate a bad topology file when running on a
  cluster that contains complex switch systems.
