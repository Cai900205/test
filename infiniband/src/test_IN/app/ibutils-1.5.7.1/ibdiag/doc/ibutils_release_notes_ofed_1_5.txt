1. Overview
===============================================================================

The ibutils package provides a set of diagnostic tools that check the health
of an InfiniBand fabric.

Package components:
ibis:     IB interface - A TCL shell that provides interface for sending various
          MADs on the IB fabric. This is the component that actually accesses
          the IB Hardware.

ibdm:     IB Data Model - A library that provides IB fabric analysis.

ibmgtsim: An IB fabric simulator. Useful for developing IB tools.

ibdiag:   This package provides 3 tools which provide the user interface
          to activate the above functionality:
            - ibdiagnet:  Performs various quality and health checks on the IB
                          fabric.
            - ibdiagpath: Performs various fabric quality and health checks on
                          the given links and nodes in a specific path.
            - ibdiagui:   A GUI wrapper for the above tools.

* New "From the Edge" topology matching algorithm.
  Integrated into ibtopodiff when run with the flag -e

* New library - libsysapi
  The library is a C API for IBDM C++ objects

* Added ibnl definition files for Mellanox and Sun IB QDR products

* Added new feature to ibdiagnet - general device info

* ibdiagnet now can get port 0 as a parameterr (for managed switches).


===============================================================================
3. Major Bugs Fixed
===============================================================================

* ibutils: various fixes in build process (dependencies, parallel build, etc)

* ibdiagnet: fixed crash with -r flag

* ibdiagnet: fixed regular expression for pkey matching

* ibdiagnet: ibdiagnet.lst file has device IDs with trailing zeroes - fixed

===============================================================================
4. Known Issues
===============================================================================

- Ibdiagnet "-wt" option may generate a bad topology file when running on a
  cluster that contains complex switch systems.
