This directory holds some tcl code of simulator tests, and
example topology files.

RunSimTest TESTS:
------------------
RunSimTest requires two files:
* a "simulator flow": *.sim.tcl file that is run in the simulator
* a "checker": *.check.tcl file that extends the RunSimTest with
  a particular flow of execution and checkers for pass/fail

osmLidAssignment - comprehensive test of lid assignment algorithm
osmMulticastRoutingTest - performs Multicast Join in random order
osmStability - check if we can get Subnet Up under many bad links
OsmTest - simply run osmtest after subnet is up

The following are ibdiagnet tests (all of them currently do not have an internal PASS/FAIL)
ibdiagnet.check.tcl - is a common checker flow that starts the SM and calls post SM
   errors injection and then ibdiagnet
ibdiag-drops.sim.tcl - set some bad links
ibdiag-dup-node-guid.sim.tcl - duplicate node guid
ibdiag-dup-port-guid.sim.tcl - duplicate port guid
ibdiag-lid.sim.tcl - post the SM run duplicate or zero some lids
ibdiag-mcast.sim.tcl - post SM create 3 MGRPs join some ports, then disconenct some MFT routing
ibdiag-ucast.sim.tcl - post SM delete some LFT entries


OTHERS:
_______
init.test.tcl - is a very simple code that only initialize
  the simulator and serve as example for the TCL API.
