IBIS stands for IB In-band Services.
It provides a TCL API for sending MADs over the local IB ports.

It also provides C API for sending batches of MADs and waiting for the entire
batch completion.

The detailed API is described in the doc/ibis_wrap.html directory.

Example applications are available in the tests directory:
ibcr_test.tcl - simple test for CR space device access
ibpm_test.tcl - simple performance monitoring agent queries
ibvs_test.tcl - vendor specific gateways testing
sac_demo.tcl - SA client queries
obj.tcl - how to dump out TCL objects fields
