                             FABRIC UTILS
                            --------------

This package provides a set of utilities that is based on a common
data model to hold a complete fabric at both the system and node levels.

ibdmchk:
-----------
 ibdmchk has two operation modes: cluster design and verification.

  CLUSTER DESIGN:
  Usage:
   ibdmchk [-v][-h][-u][-a <roots file>] -t <topology file> -n <SM Node> -p <SM Port> [-e] [-l <lmc>]

  Description:
   The Design mode is intended to be used before the cluster is built. It provides
   basic checks of the specified network as described by a topology file.
   After simulating the SM LID assignment and routing algorithms it provides reports
   of the CA to CA paths depth histogram and credit deadlock potential
   in the resulting routing scheme.

  Arguments (required):
  -t|--topo <topo file> = the topology file specifying the fabric.
  -n|--node <SM Node> = the name of the Subnet Manager node (syntax: <Topo-File-System>/U1)
  -p|--port <SM Port> = the port number by which the SM nodes is attached to the fabric.

  Options:
  -v|--verbose = verbsoe mode
  -h|--help = provide this help message
  -l|--lmc <lmc> = LMC value > 0 means assigning 2^lmc lids to each port.
  -e|--enh = use enhanced routing algorithm when LMC > 0 and report the resulting paths
       correlation (using same system/node) histogram
  -u|--updn = use up/down routing algorithm instead of OpenSM min-hop.
  -r|--roots <roots file> = a file with all the roots node names (one on each line).

  CLUSTER VERIFICATION:
  Usage:
   ibdmchk [-v][-h][-r <roots file>] [-s <subnet file>] [-f <fdb file>] [-l <lmc>]

  Description:
   After the cluster is built and OpenSM is run (using flag -D 0x43) it reports the
   subnet and FDB tables into the files /tmp/subnet.lst and /tmp/osm.fdbs.
   Based on these files the utility checks all CA to CA connectivity. Further analysis
   for credit deadlock potential is performed and reported.
   In case of an LMC > 0 it reports histograms for how many systems and nodes
   are common between the different paths for the same port pairs.
  Arguments (required):
  -l|--lmc <lmc> = The LMC value used while running OpenSM. Mandatory if not the default 0.

  Options:
  -v|--verbose = verbsoe mode
  -h|--help = provide this help message
  -s|--subnet <file> = OpenSM subnet.lst file (default is /tmp/subnet.lst)
  -f|--fdb <file> = OpenSM dump of Ucast LFDB. Use -D 0x41 to generate it.
     (default is /tmp/osm.fdbs).
  -m|--mcfdb <file> = OpenSM dump of Multicast LFDB. Use -D 0x41 to generate it.
     (default is /tmp/osm.mcfdbs).
  -r|--roots <roots file> = a file holding all root nodes guids (one per line).


ibdmtr:
-----------
Traces a direct route through the fabric while printing the path
information at both node and system levels.
Usage: ibdmtr [-v][-h] {-c <cabling file>|-t <topo file>} -s <sm node name>  -p <sm port num> -d <comma-sep-dr-path>

Description:
  This utility parses a cabling list or topology file
 describing the systems connections that make a fabric.
 Then it start following the direct route provided and
 print out the systems and nodes on the route.

Arguments:
  -t|--topology <file> = Topology file.
  -c|--cables <file> = Cabling list file. Following the line format:
   <Sys1Type> <Sys1Name> <Port1Name> <Sys2Type> <Sys2Name> <Port2Name>
  -s|--sm-node <name> = The name of the SM node (not system). E.g. OSM/U1.
  -p|--port-num <num> = The number of the port SM is connected to.
  -d|--dr-path <comm-sep-dr-path> = a list of ports to go out through

Options:
  -v|--verbose = verbsoe mode
  -h|--help = provide this help message


ibtopodiff
--------
Tests a topology file matching vs subnet.lst.

Usage: ibtopodiff [-v][-h] -t <topo file> -d <subnet file> -s <start node name> -p <start port num> -g <start port guid>

Description:

Arguments:
  -t|--topology <file> = Topology file [ibadm.topo].
  -d|--discovered <file> = [subnet.lst] file produced by OpenSM.
  -s|--start-node <name> = The name of the start node [H-1/U1].
  -p|--port-num <num> = The number of the start port [1].
  -g|--port-guid <guid> = The guid of the start port [none].

Options:
  -v|--verbose = verbsoe mode
  -h|--help = provide this help message
