Voltaire Infiniband Fabric Simulator - ibsim
============================================

Basic Description and main features.
-----------------------------------

ibsim emulates the fabric behavior by using MAD communication with the
SM/SA and the PerfMgr. This simple tool is ideally suitable for various
research, development, debug and testing tasks where IB subnet
management is involved.

For generation and reception of this MAD traffic it replaces the
/dev/umadX file descriptor interface between libibumad and ib_umad
kernel module by using preloaded libumad2sim.so shared library (umad2sim
wrapper - part of ibsim distribution). This conveys MADs to/from
SM/SA/PerfMgr to ibsim.

Any libibumad based application may work with ibsim. Kernel support
and userspace application recompilation are not required.

ibsim works locally via unix sockets or remotely via inet sockets.

For fabric topology description, ibsim uses a text file in the format
compatible with ibnetdiscover command output (for examples see
net-examples/) and it can be generated using a real cluster snapshot.

ibsim has a simple console command interface and can simulate random
packets drops and link up/down events. It is possible to run batch
commands from file via pipe or named fifo.


Building and using ibsim
------------------------

1. cd to unpacked simulator directory.

2. make ibsim and umad2sim wrapper:

    $ make

   Notes:
   - by default this will build ibsim against installed in /usr/local
     version of libib* libraries. If you like to build it against
     development tree use IB_DEV_DIR variable (or export it into
     environment):

       $ make IB_DEV_DIR=${HOME}/src/management

   - 'make dep', 'make clean' and 'make install' are available now

3. run ibsim:

    $ ./ibsim/ibsim -s <netfile>

   , where <netfile> is network definition file, it is compatible with
   output of ibnetdiscover command (+some more options are available as
   well). Some examples can be found under 'net-examples' directory.

   Notes:
   - '-s' option is in order to start the IB network immediately, the
     ibsim console may be used instead.
   - '-h' option shows ibsim command line usage and 'help' and '?'
     ibsim console commands show brief console help.

4. run libibumad based application with preloaded umad2sim wrapper:

    $ LD_PRELOAD=./umad2sim/libumad2sim.so ibnetdiscover

   , or

    $ LD_PRELOAD=./umad2sim/libumad2sim.so opensm -f -

   Notes:
   - in order to run OpenSM as non-privileged user you may need to
     export OSM_CACHE_DIR variable and to use '-f' option in order to
     specify writable path to OpenSM log file.
   - Point of attachment is indicated by SIM_HOST environment variable.
     If not specified, first entry in topology file is used. For OpenSM,
     if -g option is used, it must be the same as this.

5. Enjoy and comment.
