	* srp_daemon: Add a new tool srp_daemon. srp_daemon check for 
	new targets that join the fabric. It can also ask ib_srp module
	to connect to these targets.

	* Makefile.am: Was changed to call to srp_daemon Makefile.

	* Configure.in: Was changed to include srp_daemon.

	* src/srp-dm.c (get_node): Use correct attribute ID to retrieve
	NodeRecord -- old code incorrectly queried for a PortInfoRecord.

2006-06-14  Roland Dreier  <rdreier@cisco.com>

	* src/srp-dm.c: Add support for SMs that support queries of
	PortInfo that match only specified bits in the CapabilityMask.
	This will be more efficient on large fabrics, since only ports
	with the IsDM bit will be queried, instead of retrieving the full
	node record table for the full fabric.

	* src/srp-dm.h: Change SRP_DM_ATTR_CLASS_PORT_INFO to
	SRP_ATTR_CLASS_PORT_INFO, since it is not a per-class value.

	* src/srp-dm.c: Change agent array into a single value, since only
	the QP1 agent is ever used.

2006-06-08  Roland Dreier  <rdreier@cisco.com>

	* src/srp-dm.c (get_port_list): In some setups (eg Cisco SFS 3001
	with an FC gateway), there will be switches with the IsDM bit set
	on port 0.  So the initial get of NodeRecords must retrieve all
	records, not just CA ports.

2006-06-07  Roland Dreier  <rdreier@cisco.com>
	* src/srp-dm.c (do_port): Use correct endianness when comparing
	GUID against Topspin OUI.

	* src/srp-dm.c (set_class_port_info): Trivial whitespace fixes.

2006-05-29  Ishai Rabinovitz  <ishai@mellanox.co.il>

	* src/srp-dm.c (main): The agent ID array is declared with 0
	entries, which leads to corruption when it is filled in by
	create_agent().  Fix that by declaring it with the correct number
	of entries, 2.

2006-04-10  Roland Dreier  <rdreier@cisco.com>

	* configure.in: srptools no longer needs to check for libsysfs.

	* src/srp-dm.c: Remove use of libsysfs -- just read directly to
	get what we need.
	Make functions static, since they are only used in one file.

2006-01-18  Yael Shenhav  <yaeli@mellanox.co.il>

	* src/ib_user_mad.h: Use __u16/__u32 instead of __be16/__be32,
	since not all toolchains export __beXX types to userspace.

2006-01-17  Roland Dreier  <rdreier@cisco.com>

	* Release as version 0.03
