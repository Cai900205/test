knem 1.1.1 (February 24th, 2014)
================================

* Fix dmaengine build with Linux kernel 3.13.
* Fix driver build when strict uid checking is enabled.
* Check DMA channel alignment contraints and work around overzealous
  restrictions on buggy IOAT RAID platforms.

knem 1.1.0 (July 25th 2013)
===========================

* Fix a possible crash when trying to access an non-existing region
  (bug introduced by overzealous check in 1.0.0 release).
* Add KNEM_FLAG_NOTIFY_FD to queue asynchronous request completions
  in the file descriptor so that the application can poll/read there.
  See knem_io.h and knem-api.html for details.
  Thanks to Scott Atchley for his help.
* Regions are now only accessible to processes belonging to the same
  user, by default. The new KNEM_FLAG_ANY_USER_ACCESS flag should be
  passed when creating the region to revert to the old behavior where
  all processes may access a declared region.
* When reading context verbose stats from /dev/knem as non-root,
  list all contexts owned by the user.
* It is now impossible to read (or clear) statistics through a file
  descriptor attached to a context.
  + Reading would get NOTIFY_FD completions instead.
* Fix build with 3.9+ kernels where the dmaengine and idr interfaces
  have been cleaned up.
* Fix bugs in the driver mmap error path.

knem 1.0.0 (October 8th 2012)
=============================

* Fix build with 3.5+ kernels where kmap_atomic changed.
* Fix build with 3.7+ kernels where MAX_ID_MASK was renamed into MAX_IDR_MASK.

knem 0.9.8 (February 21st 2012)
===============================

* Add -O option to set minimal workset size in knem_pingpong, to
  work around caches.
* Add knem_region_cost program to benchmark region create and destroy.
* Some RCU cleanups in the driver.
* Miscellaneous other improvements everywhere, especially in test programs.

knem 0.9.7 (July 29th 2011)
===========================

* Fix wrong locking when trying to mmap the status array twice.
* Modify the requirements on the target kernel configuration to better
  cope with current distribution kernels.
* Show driver configuration summary at the end of configure.
* Add support for DMA engine on RHEL/CentOS 5 kernels.
* Fix support for Linux kernel 3.x releases.
* Minor documentation improvements.

knem 0.9.6 (April 2nd 2011)
===========================

* Small pinning performance improvement by removing useless locking.
* Clarify the reporting of counters when reading /dev/knem.
* Minor fixes in the driver build configuration.
* Minor execution fixes to some tests program.

knem 0.9.5 (February 1st 2011)
==============================

* Fix a race condition that could cause a crash when destroying a region
  when another process starts accessing it.
* Fix a memory leak when submitting empty copies.
* Switch to the new hwloc bitmap API by default.

knem 0.9.4 (December 16th 2010)
===============================

* Mark pages as dirty when we wrote to a region.
* Fix check_kernel_headers.sh to properly execute as a shell script in
  a portable manner.

knem 0.9.3 (October 20th 2010)
==============================

* Add new "bounded" variants of copy and inline copy ioctls which take
  an additional length parameter so as not to copy until the end of the
  given regions or iovecs.
* Add an non-locally-pinned implementation of inline copy from a local
  region (write=1).
  + Disable by default for now since it seems slower in most cases,
    pinlocalread=0 in module parameters should be passed to enable it.
* Fix build when configure is invoked with an absolute path.
* Update documentation about the switch from SVN to GIT.

knem 0.9.2 (August 30th 2010, svn r529)
=======================================

* Many improvements to the HTML documentation and to the API comments
  in knem_io.h.
* Add DKMS support to ease kernel module update when a new kernel is
  installed. See dkms.conf for details.
* Fix the detection of hwloc at configure to properly support cross-
  compilation environments and installations in custom directories.
* Use automake to implement make check.
* Misc minor fixes.

knem 0.9.1 (July 6th 2010, svn r488)
====================================
The hwloc release.

* When enforcing the kernel thread binding with the BIND_OFFLOAD ioctl,
  take precedence over the binding kernel module parameter.
* When hwloc is available, place one process per core by default in
  knem_collectives instead of one per logical processor.
* Add knem_offload_test to benchmark the overlapping and copying
  abilities when offloading the copy on a kernel thread on the same
  hyperthread, core, socket, ... using hwloc to traverse the topology
  up to its top.
* Touch udev rules at the end of RPM package install so that udev reloads
  them properly once the rdma group was created.
* Some documentation updates.
  + Split knem-api.html out of knem.html
* Add REPORTING-BUGS, README.devel, TODO and autogen.sh to the tarball.

knem 0.9.0 (June 14th 2010, svn r465)
=====================================

* Wait for deferred callbacks to be done before unloading the module,
  otherwise the kernel may oops if some processes did not cleanup their
  resources yet.
* Remove unneeded locking around idr_for_each.
* Install a udev rule file in ${prefix}/etc/10-knem.rules so as to
  make /dev/knem group 'rdma' by default.
* Add a knem_local_install script to install the module and udev rules in
  the standard directories so that modprobe finds the module and udev setups
  the device group automatically.
* Add a RPM spec file to ease packaging through rpmbuild -tb <tarball>.
* Document the installation process.

knem 0.8.901 aka 0.9-rc1 (May 18th 2010, svn r447)
==================================================
The IDR release.

* Fix process id management when the kernel has been running for a very
  long time (cookie generation may be wrong, causing the lookup to fail
  when submitting a copy).
* Fix build on 2.6.34 kernel.
* Increase the number of instances that may use knem at the same time:
  + When using a recent kernel (2.6.27 or later, with RCU-ready IDR), the
    actual limit is practically unreachable.
  + Otherwise, bump the limit to 1024 so that each process may use multiple
    contexts at the same time for different communicators or communication
    implementations.
* Improve closing time by releasing resources asynchronously using a RCU
  callback.
* Improve region lookup thanks to a IDR instead of a hash table when using
  a recent kernel (2.6.27 or later, with RCU-ready IDR).
* Cleanup the allocation of region ids by using a IDA to make really sure
  two regions will never have the same id at the same time.
* Applications now must open the device in write mode to get knem features,
  readers only get the ability to read statistics.
* Only list other processes in verbose statistics if we have administrator
  privileges.
* Add knem_collectives tool program to benchmark Nto1 and 1toN operations
  with multiple processes accessing a single memory region simultaneously.
* Add knem_cost tool program to benchmark low-level operations.
* Rename tools better.
* Cleanup tools usage.
* Miscellaneous code rework and improvements.
* Update documentation and README.

knem 0.8.1 (March 22nd 2010, svn r370)
======================================

* Switch from CeCILL-B to BSD license.
* Documentation updates.

knem 0.8.0 (March 3rd 2010, svn r363)
=====================================

* Fix build on final 2.6.33 kernel.
* Added a workaround for issues with the kernel build system trying to
  create files in the build directory during make install.

knem 0.7.901 (February 1st 2010, svn r356)
==========================================
The scalable release.

* Use RCU locks to optimize the lookup of the target process and of regions
  (when the SINGLEUSE flag isn't set).
* Improve scalability with the number of regions by storing them in a hash
  table instead of a single list.
* Fix the status_test user program on 32bit architectures.
* Fix make check to not try to bind processes on non-existing cores on
  machines with only 1 or 2 cores.
* Fix some debug messages in the driver.
* Do not ignore the DMA copy flag when DMA is disabled totally in the kernel,
  just don't try to use DMA (as if there was no DMA channel available).
* No need to setup the DMA cleanup timer if not using DMA.
* List currently open knem instances and regions when reading /dev/knem
  when verbose statistics are enabled.
* Properly handle potential buffer overflow when reading /dev/knem.
* Cleanup the management of KCC and KARCH when configuring the kernel build.

knem 0.7.0 (December 15th 2009, svn r319)
=========================================

* Miscellaneous minor changes.

knem 0.6.901 aka 0.7-rc1 (December 1st 2009, svn r313)
======================================================

* Add a new extended region-based API.
  + The old API is still supported but may be dropped in the future,
    see the end of knem_io.h for upgrade instructions.
* Add status_test and multifd_test tools.
* Properly report errors in synchronous receive commands.
* If DMA is requested and not available, ioctls now fails with EINVAL.
  abi.features may tell if DMA is actually supported.
* Fix support for kernel 2.6.32.
* Add a doc/knem.html documentation explaining the ioctl interface.

knem 0.6.0 (June 25th 2009, svn r209)
=====================================

* Workaround a kernel panic that may occur on 2.6.18 kernels
  because of the broken vmalloc_user() implementation.
* Rework the cleanup of pending DMA copies by not waking up the
  kernel thread every second. Do some cleanup on ioctls instead,
  and use a timer in case no ioctls is ever invoked.
  + This change stabilizes performance for long runs thanks to
    much fewer spurious kernel thread wakeups.
* Use get_user_pages_fast() when available to improve
  performance a bit by reducing the pinning overhead.
* Allow changing the target kernel with --with-linux-release
  instead of only enforcing its release name within knem.
* Switch to automake.

knem 0.5.0 (March 9th 2009, svn r167)
=====================================

* Fix buggy signed/unsigned mixing that causes the driver
  to never find some valid send lids.
* Misc cleanups in the driver to improve coding style and
  make the sparse checker happy.
* Rework request flags and module parameters to match the
  now default synchronous mode.

knem 0.4.0 (February 15th 2009, svn r144)
=========================================

* Bind the kernel thread near as user the process by default
  (binding=1).
* Do not offload small copies to the DMA engine, revert to
  memcpy(). Threshold is 1024 bytes by default.
* Disable offloading of work to a kernel thread by default.
  + Rework the corresponding flags and module parameters.
* More module parameters, request flags, and device features
  cleanups.
* Add support for 2.6.29.
* Dump the driver config when reading /dev/knem.
* Add some counters, to be dumped with the driver config.
  + Only strictly consistent in debug mode, for perfomance
    reasons.

knem 0.3.0 (December 22nd 2008, svn r110)
=========================================

* Enable DMA by default.
* Add a binding module parameter and a BIND_OFFLOAD ioctl to bind
  the kernel thread properly.
* Add more flags and module parameters to control DMA and memcpy
  synchronous modes, and cleanup the code all-around.
* Fix a oops on invalid pid in cookie.

knem 0.2.0 (December 9th 2008, svn r89)
=======================================

* Add DMA engine support, to be enabled with module parameter dma=1.
  + CONFIG_NET_DMA is required in the kernel, and the ioatdma kernel
    module should be loaded.
* Replace the get-abi ioctl with a new get-info which also retrieves
  a mask of driver features.
* Add a flags parameter to send/recv to configure whether the driver
  should enforce synchronous mode, DMA, ...

knem 0.1.0 (November 16th 2008, svn r70)
========================================

* Add an asynchronous memcpy implementation (based on a kernel thread
  for each knem process) and enable it by default.
  + Add the "sync" module parameter to revert to synchronous memcpy
    if set to 1.
  + Add the "pinrecv" module parameter to enforce pinning on the receive
    side (even in synchronous mode) if set to 1.
* Add the "debug" module parameter to get kernel messages when an error
  occurs in the driver.
  + Add --enable-debug to switch debug on from the configure command
    line.

knem 0.0.3 (November 13th 2008, svn r35)
========================================

* Miscellaneous fix and cleanups.

knem 0.0.2 (November 11th 2008, svn r24)
========================================

* Make the user-space API asynchronous.
  + The driver still works synchronously for now.
* Add various examples in the tools directory.
* Add complete make and make install support.
* Misc fixes.

knem 0.0.1 (October 29th 2008, svn r0)
======================================

First release with synchronous memcpy support.
