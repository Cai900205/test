<h3>Interface Basics</h3>
<p>
 Once loaded, the KNEM kernel module creates a <tt>/dev/knem</tt> pseudo-character device
 (see the <a href="knem.html">main documentation</a> for details about granting access rights to this file).
 <b>Applications must open this file (in read/write mode) before passing commands to the driver</b>.
</p>
<pre>
  #include &lt;knem_io.h&gt;

  ...
  knem_fd = open(KNEM_DEVICE_FILENAME, O_RDWR);
</pre>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h3>Preparing remote access to a local memory region</h3>
<p>
 To prepare access to local memory from another process,
 <b>declare a memory region</b>
 (composed of one or several segments) and pass it to the driver.
</p>
<pre>
  struct knem_cmd_create_region create;
  struct knem_cmd_param_iovec knem_iov[2];
  ...
  knem_iov[0].base = &lt;myaddress&gt;
  knem_iov[0].len = &lt;mylength&gt;
  knem_iov[1].base = &lt;myotheraddress&gt;
  knem_iov[1].len = &lt;myotherlength&gt;
  ...
  create.iovec_array = (uintptr_t) &knem_iov[0];
  create.iovec_nr = 2;
  create.flags = KNEM_FLAG_SINGLEUSE; /* automatically destroy after first use */
  create.protection = PROT_READ; /* only allow remote readers */
  err = ioctl(knem_fd, KNEM_CMD_CREATE_REGION, &create);
</pre>
<p>
 The region has been stored in the driver and associated to a 64bits cookie
 whose value is now available in <tt>create.cookie</tt>.
</p>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h3>Accessing a remote memory region</h3>
<p>
 Once the region creation returned a cookie,
 the application may <b>pass this cookie to the receiver</b>
 (using another way of communication).
 The receiver process then <b>passes its own array of destination memory segments</b>
 (where data should be copied to)
 to the driver along with the corresponding remote cookie.
</p>
<pre>
  struct knem_cmd_inline_copy icopy;
  struct knem_cmd_param_iovec knem_iov[5];
  ...
  knem_iov[0].base = &lt;myaddress&gt;
  knem_iov[0].len = &lt;mylength&gt;
  ... setup others knem_iovs as well ...
  knem_iov[4].base = &lt;myfifthaddress&gt;
  knem_iov[4].len = &lt;myfifthlength&gt;
  ...
  icopy.local_iovec_array = (uintptr_t) &knem_iov[0];
  icopy.local_iovec_nr = 5;
  icopy.remote_cookie = &lt;myremotecookie&gt;;
  icopy.remote_offset = 0;
  icopy.write = 0; /* read from the remote region into our local segments */
  icopy.flags = 0;
  err = ioctl(knem_fd, KNEM_CMD_INLINE_COPY, &icopy);
</pre>
<p>
 If the ioctl succeeds (return 0), it means that the copy was properly initialized.
 In case of error during the copy (as opposed to during its initialization),
 it is reported in the request status.
 In this example, the request is processed synchronously.
 The status is then available immediately in <tt>icopy.current_status</tt>.
</p>
<pre>
  if (icopy.current_status != KNEM_STATUS_SUCCESS)
    printf("request failed\n");
</pre>
<p>
 It is also possible to initiate a data transfer using a declared
 region.
</p>
<pre>
  struct knem_cmd_copy copy;
  struct knem_cmd_create_region create;
  struct knem_cmd_param_iovec knem_iov[3];
  ...
  knem_iov[0].base = &lt;myaddress&gt;
  knem_iov[0].len = &lt;mylength&gt;
  ... setup the other knem_iov as well ...
  knem_iov[2].base = &lt;mythirdaddress&gt;
  knem_iov[2].len = &lt;mythirdlength&gt;
  ...
  create.iovec_array = (uintptr_t) &knem_iov[0];
  create.iovec_nr = 3;
  create.flags = KNEM_FLAG_SINGLEUSE; /* automatically destroy after first use */
  create.protection = PROT_WRITE; /* only writers */
  err = ioctl(knem_fd, KNEM_CMD_CREATE_REGION, &create);
  ...
  copy.src_cookie = &lt;myremotecookie&gt;; /* read from the other process */
  copy.src_offset = 0;
  copy.dst_cookie = &lt;create.cookie&gt;; /* write in our local region */
  copy.dst_offset = 0;
  copy.flags = 0;
  err = ioctl(knem_fd, KNEM_CMD_COPY, &amp;copy);
</pre>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h3>Reusing memory regions multiple times</h3>
<p>
 The above code tells the driver to destroy the memory region after its first use
 because of <tt>KNEM_FLAG_SINGLEUSE</tt>.
 It is possible to keep the region available after use by removing this flag
 at region creation (just set <tt>create.flags</tt> to 0 before the ioctl).
 The region will then be accessible multiple times by any KNEM process.
 It will only be destroyed when the owner process exits or when it
 explicitly destroys it:
</p>
<pre>
  err = ioctl(knem_fd, KNEM_CMD_DESTROY_REGION, &&lt;mycookie&gt;);
</pre>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h3>Asynchronous requests</h3>
<p>
 By default, KNEM processes requests synchronously, which means the
 above <tt>current_status</tt> will be set as soon as the ioctl returns.
 It is also possible to perform <b>asynchronous data transfers</b> through
 a kernel thread by adding the corresponding flag in the receive ioctl:
</p>
<pre>
  icopy.flags = KNEM_FLAG_MEMCPYTHREAD;
</pre>
<p>
 Such an asynchronous request will show <tt>KNEM_STATUS_PENDING</tt>
 in <tt>current_status</tt>. It means that further polling is required
 to know when the request actually completes in the background.
 To do so, the ioctl must specify where the asynchronous status should be updated:
</p>
<pre>
  icopy.async_status_index = &lt;myindex&gt;;
</pre>
 It is an index within an array of status slots that should be allocated
 at initialization by mapping the device file.
 This array may be mapped only once per file descriptor,
 but its size may be freely chosen by the application
 (depending on how many simultaneous pending requests it may need,
  up to 2^32 status slots).
</p>
<pre>
  static volatile knem_status_t *knem_status;
  #define KNEM_STATUS_NR 4096
  ...
  knem_status = mmap(NULL, KNEM_STATUS_NR, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, knem_fd, KNEM_STATUS_ARRAY_FILE_OFFSET);
  ...
</pre>
<p>
 When submitting a request with <tt>async_status_index = N</tt>,
 the application may be notified of the completion by looking at
 the corresponding index in the <tt>knem_status</tt> array.
 The driver takes care of automatically freeing the corresponding
 sender and receiver resources.
 Note that you should always check the <tt>current_status</tt> first,
 since some requests might be processed synchronously in case of
 missing features in the driver.
</p>
<pre>
  if (icopy.current_status != KNEM_STATUS_PENDING) {
    /* completed synchronously */
    if (icopy.current_status != KNEM_STATUS_SUCCESS)
      printf("request failed\n");
  } else {
    /* processed asynchronously, waiting for completion */
    while (knem_status[&lt;myindex&gt;] == KNEM_STATUS_PENDING);
    /* completed asynchronously */
    if (knem_status[&lt;myindex&gt;] != KNEM_STATUS_SUCCESS)
      printf("request failed\n");
  }
</pre>
<p>
 Again, initialization problems (synchronous) are reported in the
 ioctl return value, while actual copy issues (during the asynchronous
 processing) are reported in the request status, either
 <tt>current_status</tt> one or later in the asynchronous one.
</p>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h3>I/OAT copy offload through DMA Engine</h3>
<p>
 One interesting asynchronous feature is certainly <b>I/OAT copy offload</b>.
</p>
<pre>
  icopy.flags = KNEM_FLAG_DMA;
</pre>
<p>
 If DMA engine is not supported by the kernel or the hardware, setting this flag
 will cause the ioctl to fail.
 To know if DMA is supported, you may get information about the driver
 and check its feature flags:
</p>
<pre>
  struct knem_cmd_info info;
  ...
  err = ioctl(knem_fd, KNEM_CMD_GET_INFO, &info);
  if (info.features & KNEM_FEATURE_DMA)
    printf("DMA engine is supported\n");
</pre>
<p>
 The ultimate strategy is to enable overlapping of data transfer
 with computation by using an <b>asynchronous data transfer with I/OAT</b>.
 The aforementioned while loop will thus not return immediately and
 the application may perform useful work before the request is actually done.
</p>
<pre>
  icopy.flags = KNEM_FLAG_DMA | KNEM_FLAG_ASYNCDMACOMPLETE;
</pre>
<p>
 If DMA does not seem to work (for instance if KNEM_FEATURE_DMA is missing in <tt>info.features</tt>),
 you may want to check DMA engine status in the driver:
</p>
<pre>
  $ cat /dev/knem
  [...]
   DMAEngine: KernelSupported Enabled ChansAvail ChunkMin=1024B
</pre>
<p>
 The above line	means that DMA Engine is supported by the kernel, enabled in
 KNEM and that some DMA channels are available.
 <i>NoKernelSupport</i> would mean that DMA Engine support is missing in the kernel.
 <i>NoChannelAvailable</i> would means that DMA Engine is supported by the kernel
 but no hardware DMA engine is available or no driver was loaded to use it.
 On Intel machines, loading the <tt>ioatdma</tt> kernel module will usually help.
</p>
</div>


<div class="section">
<h3>Blocking support</h3>
<p>
 Starting with KNEM 1.1, asynchronous request completions may be
 notified through the KNEM file descriptor.
 When the <tt>KNEM_FLAG_NOTIFY_FD</tt> is added to an asynchronous
 copy request, its completion queues an event in the descriptor.
 This event may be read as a <tt>uint32_t</tt> that contains the request
 <tt>async_status_index</tt>.
 The file descriptor also supports <tt>poll()</tt>/<tt>select()</tt>.
 Blocking and non-blocking file descriptors are both supported.
</p>
<pre>
  /* submit a asynchronous copy request */
  ...
  copy.flags = KNEM_FLAG_MEMCPYTHREAD | KNEM_FLAG_NOTIFY_FD;
  copy.async_status_index = 7;
  err = ioctl(knem_fd, KNEM_CMD_COPY, &amp;copy);
  ...
  /* sleep indefinitely until the request completes */
  int err;
  struct pollfd p;
  p.fd = knem_fd;
  p.events = POLLIN;
  err = poll(&p, 1, -1);
  /* poll was woken up, something likely happened in the knem file descriptor */
  if (err > 0 && (p.revents &amp; POLLIN)) {
    uint32_t index;
    err = read(knem_fd, &amp;index, sizeof(index));
    /* index now contains 7 (the async_status_index passed in the copy request) */
    /* status slot 7 is set to KNEM_STATUS_SUCCESS or (FAILED) */
  }
</pre>
