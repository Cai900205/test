 on how to use KNEM within your applications or MPI implementations.

<div class="section">
<h3>Installing KNEM</h3>
<p>
 KNEM configures, builds and installs as usual.
</p>
<pre>
 $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/knem
 $ make
 $ make install
</pre>
<p>
 If building from a GIT glone, you may need to install automake >=1.10
 and autoconf >=2.61, and then prepare the script before configure:
</p>
<pre>
 $ ./autogen.sh
</pre>
<p>
 Everything is installed in the prefix directory (<tt>/opt/knem</tt>
 by default), including the kernel module and udev rules file.
 If you want modprobe and udev to properly handle KNEM, the relevant
 files should be installed in <tt>/lib/modules</tt> and
 <tt>/etc/udev/rules.d</tt> instead. To do so:
</p>
<pre>
 $ /path/to/knem/install/sbin/knem_local_install
</pre>
<p>
 Usually, <tt>make install</tt> will run only once per cluster and
 install in a shared directory, while <tt>knem_local_install</tt>
 will run once per machine since <tt>/lib/modules</tt> and
 <tt>/etc/udev/rules.d</tt> are not shared between machines.
</p>
<p>
 If you ever want to uninstall KNEM, you may run:
</p>
<pre>
 $ rmmod knem
 $ /path/to/knem/install/sbin/knem_local_install --uninstall
 $ make uninstall
</pre>
<p>
 It is also possible to build KNEM as a RPM package which bundles
 the result of both <tt>make install</tt> and <tt>knem_local_install</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
 $ rpmbuild -tb knem-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz
</pre>
<p>
 KNEM also supports DKMS (Dynamic Kernel Module Support) which lets
 the system automatically rebuild and install modules for new kernels.
 See <tt>dkms.conf</tt> for details.
</p>
</div>



<div class="section">
<h3>Starting KNEM</h3>
<p>
 To start KNEM, assuming you ran <tt>knem_local_install</tt>, just run:
</p>
<pre>
 $ modprobe knem
</pre>
<p>
 By default, udev will set the <tt>/dev/knem</tt> device group to <em>rdma</em>.
 Thus any KNEM user should be added to this group first.
</p>
<p>
 If you did not run <tt>knem_local_install</tt>, you may still load
 the kernel module and setup the device group manually:
</p>
<pre>
 $ insmod /path/to/knem/install/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/knem.ko
 $ chgrp rdma /dev/knem
</pre>
<p>
 If the <em>rdma</em> group does not exist on your machine, you may
 modify the udev rule to set the mode to <tt>0666</tt> and not to
 change the file group.
</p>
</div>



<div class="section">
<h3>Configuring your MPI implementation to use KNEM</h3>
<p>
 MPICH2 supports KNEM since version 1.1.1 (it is therefore also supported by MVAPICH2 1.5).
 To use it, you should add the following options to the configure line:
</p>
<pre>
 --with-nemesis-local-lmt=dma --with-knem=/path/to/knem/install/
</pre>
<p>
 It will use KNEM starting at 64kB messages, and offload copies to DMA engine after 2MB.
 To change the latter threshold, use the environment variable <tt>MPICH_NEM_LMT_DMA_THRESHOLD</tt>.
</p>
<br />
<p>
 Open MPI supports KNEM since version 1.5.0.
 To use it, you should add the following option to the configure line:
</p>
<pre>
 --with-knem=/path/to/knem/install/
</pre>
<p>
 KNEM will be used at runtime after 4kB.
 You may change this threshold with <tt>--mca btl_sm_eager_limit 32768</tt>.
 You may also disable KNEM entirely at runtime with <tt>--mca btl_sm_use_knem 0</tt>.
 KNEM will not offload copies to DMA engine by default.
 You should use <tt>--mca btl_sm_knem_dma_min 1048576</tt> to enable copy offload starting at 1MB.
</p>
<br />
<p>
 To check that KNEM is properly used, see <a href="#stats">Getting Statistics</a>.
 Make sure your users are members of the <em>rdma</em> group so that they are
 granted access to the <tt>/dev/knem</tt> device file.
</p>
<p>
 If you want to port your MPI implementation to KNEM,
 see the <a href="knem-api.html">interface documentation</a>.
</p>
</div>



<div class="section" id="stats">
<h3>Getting Statistics</h3>
<p>
 To check that KNEM is properly used, how it processed requests, why some of
 them failed, you may read statistics:
</p>
<pre>
  $ cat /dev/knem
  [...]
   Requests submitted                           : 10243
   Requests processed (total)                   : 10236
            processed (using DMA)               : 0
            processed (offloaded to thread)     : 0
  [...]
   Requests rejected (invalid flags)            : 5
            rejected (not enough memory)        : 2
  [...]
   Requests failed during memcpy from/to user   : 1
            failed during DMA copy              : 0
</pre>
<p>
 These statistics may also be cleared by a privileged user:
</p>
<pre>
  # echo 1 > /dev/knem
</pre>
<p>
 If the knem module was loaded with parameter <tt>statsverbose=1</tt>
 (appended to the <tt>insmod</tt> or <tt>modprobe</tt> command-line),
 reading from <tt>/dev/knem</tt> will also list the currently open
 memory regions for the current process
 (and even from all processes if the user is privileged).
</p>
<pre>
  # cat /dev/knem
  [...]
   Context 5d343d48
    Region 5d344ad1 SingleUse
    Listed 1 regions
   Context 5d343d49
    Listed 0 regions
   Listed 8 contexts
</pre>
