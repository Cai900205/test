Compiling for VMware is somewhat like compiling for Windows - there is
a separate, standalone makefile one uses.  In this case, it is
src/Makefile.uw.

Also, seems the way things are "run" under VMware is enough different
that the scripts, should you chose to use them, will need to be
modified.  The initial set of patches make some arbitrary changes that
need to be re-worked with some "To run this under VMware uncomment
this line" or somesuch.
