This CEETM configuration file describes hierarchy of queue, channel and
network interface of CEETM. The same configuration will be applied to
every interface enabled in usdpaa and in application.
The configuration must be compliant with CEETM rules, here is a simple illustration

<ceetm>	root node of this xml file

<lni>	Logic network interface, only one for each interface
	control:‘shaped’ if shaper is placed on this interface; ‘unshaped’ otherwise
	cr:	bandwidth for Commit Rate
	er:	bandwidth for Excess Rate

<channel>	Each LNI contains 8 CQ channels at most
	control:‘shaped’ if shaper is placed on this channel; ‘unshaped’ otherwise
	group:	0 – no group; 1 – only groupA enabled; 2 – both groupA/B are enabled
	cr/er:	See above

<groupA/B>	Class queue group under CQ channel
		groupA has 8 CQs (8-15) if no groupB required or has 4 CQs (8-11) if groupB required
	idx:	The priority of the group.
		The group with idx 'n' has priority higher than CQn but lower than CQ(n-1)
	op:	Eligibility of the group.
		cr – cr eligible; er – er eligible; both - cr/er

<cq>	Each channel has 16 class queues
		CQ 0-7 are scheduled using strict priority(SP)
		CQ 8-15 are scheduled using a weighted scheduling algorithm(WBFS)
	idx:	CQ id, ranging from 0 to 15
	op:	Eligibility of SP class queue. Not applicable to WBFS CQs
		cr – cr eligible; er – er eligible; both - cr/er
	weight:	Weight of WBFS class queue. Not applicable to SP CQs
