	OSID - Outbound Segmentation Interleaving Disable
	Segmentation interleaving allows the message manager to
	interleave segments from two or more transactions with the
	same destination device ID (regardless of type). This may
	increase performance for transmission but may also consume
	additional reassembly resources at the destination.

	A non-Freescale target device may not complete Type 9
	reassembly correctly when segmentation interleaving is
	performed on two PDUs with the same flow but different CoS.
	Workaround: disable segmentation interleaving by setting
